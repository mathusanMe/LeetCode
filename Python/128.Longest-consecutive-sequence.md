# 128.Longest-consecutive-sequence

# Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```other
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is[1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```other
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <=` $10^5$
- $-10^9$ `<= nums[i] <=` $10^9$

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numsSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0
        for n in numsSet:
            if n - 1 in numsSet:
                continue
            k = 0
            while (n + k) in numsSet:
                k += 1
            longest = max(longest, k)
            
        return longest
```
