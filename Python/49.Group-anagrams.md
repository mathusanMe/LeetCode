# 49.Group-anagrams

# Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```other
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```other
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

**Example 3:**

```other
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <=` $10^4$
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution

For this problem, we are going to build groups of anagrams based on sorted tuple of each string.

> We canâ€™t use lists as subscript because of their non-hashability. Otherwise, tuple is less resource intensive than string.

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagrams = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            anagrams[tuple(sorted(s))].append(s)
        return anagrams.values()
```
